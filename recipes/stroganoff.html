    <h1>Stroganoff Recipe</h1>
    <img src="../images/stroganoff.jpg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>For this chicken stroganoff recipe, I wanted something like the traditional beef stroganoff and threw this one together, 
       writing down everything as I went so I wouldn't forget. 
       I served it with noodles, but rice would be great too. 
       For a complete meal, make asparagus for a vegetable side and a green or fruit salad. 
       Nutmeg seems to be the secret ingredient of many stroganoff recipes.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour for coating</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>2 cups fresh sliced mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups half-and-half cream</li>
        <li>1 (1 ounce) package dry onion soup mix</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>

    <ol>
        <li>Place flour in a shallow dish or bowl and season with salt and pepper. Dredge chicken in seasoned flour to coat.</li>
